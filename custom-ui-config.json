    "Tab2Text1": "While playing on our servers, we ask that you respect others and maintain a mature attitude.

1) Stay frosty: Do not insult, scam, shit talk, or troll others. Do not bring up controversial topics in global or public channels. Also, always ask if a controversial topic is ok before bringing it up even in private channels.

2) No trolls allowed. No intentional trolling, feigning idiocy, shitposting, or blatant lying. We are a community of people with similar interests just here to have a good time. We do not condone abusive behavior. This is not the place for trying to get a rise out of others.

3) Do not DM our team members. We have a support ticket system in place on our Discord server. Visit us there and submit a ticket to ask for help.

4) No doxxing: We do not allow distribution of ANYONE's sensitive or personal information.

5) Use appropriate survivor names. No blank names, no long names, no URL names, and no non-ASCII Unicode characters in names. Names that contain non-standard characters or emojis are subject to admin name change.

6) No advertising. No referral links. No buying/selling/trading anything for real life goods or money.

7) We do not allow players to use our platform to send others invitations to other Discord servers, game communities, or game servers.

8) Use common sense. If you're doing something you think is wrong, it probably is and will probably get you some attention from the admins.

9) Use English in global chat. If you need to speak another language, use whisper, tribe, or alliance chat.",
    "Tab2Text2": "1) Base size limit is 50x50.

2) No pillaring or foundation stacking.

3) No building in artifact caves or blocking cave entrances with your base. This includes placing teleports--no teleports allowed in artifact caves or cave entrances.

4) Your base should be outside the render range of anyone else's base.",
    "Tab2Text3": "1) All players must be a member of a tribe. Solo players must create a tribe in order to fulfill this requirement.

2) If you are a member of our Discord server, your Discord server nickname must be the same as your ARK survivor name.

3) If running from dinos that are attacking you, do not run near another tribe's base. You will be held responsible for damage caused to another tribe's base.",
